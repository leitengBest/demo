Hi my mentors,
Today we did  a examination for springMVC , the results of the assessment, however, let me very disappointed.
Reason has the following two points: one, there is no correct understanding of demand .Second, the technical ability is insufficient,
can't quickly complete perfect coding tasks. 
Mentor for we need to master the knowledge we have make a list for us,
that's a nice help, let us learn the direction and priorities,
but because of my daily time arrangement is not reasonable, cause I wasted a lot of time, 
so the real effective learning techniques is very little time, so my schedule is not keep up with my mentor the required level. 
Therefore, in view of this, I should come to the conclusion that I every day in inappropriate behavior, arrange their own time,
reasonable plan to learn myself, so as to ensure that I can finish it on time every day at least I should accomplish tasks, and we are still far from the power of the team together, although we have begun the group division of tasks, but still not reach optimization of power, in order to we can smoothly through this special period, we a team of highly unified closer cooperation, is that we must pursue. 
My plan is to continue to learn spingMVC tomorrow, build maven environment, perfect the content of my making account at the same time, quickly use up all of our tools, optimizing their own schedules, the daily task to be accomplished both in quality and quantity. 
	Yours sincerely,
LeiTeng
